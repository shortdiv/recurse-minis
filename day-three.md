# Day Three:
I slowed down my pace on day 3, to give myself a break from coding and thinking about code 24/7. Woke up early-ish and managed to sneak in a visit to a local shala to work my dormant ashtanga muscles. After that, I took a walk around Central Park to beat the morning rush and switch up my morning commute into RC. I admit I felt a little guilty to not be working on code right away but the pause to take in the sights and sounds of New York was well worth the time.

When I did finally get back to code, I worked on learning about buffers in WebGL and primitive types in WebGL. Despite my slow progress on figuring out primitive types, I managed to make a breakthrough ~9pm. Now I can now draw shapes using some WebGL code and explain how/why they look the way they do. Hurray!

I also spent a bit of the day pairing on some React, express and Postman code. It was really awesome getting back into writing/reading React code and it's given me de better perspective and reference to think about the differences between Vue and React a little more critically. 

## Things Learned
- How the coordinate system really works
- Used primitive types in webGL and learnt the difference between TRIANGLES, TRIANGLE_STRIP, TRIANGLE_FAN etc. Now I can draw shapes composed of triangles!
- I get how Array Buffers work!

## Things to Learn (that I know of)
- Drawing a circle in WebGL
- Translations/Transforms/etc in WebGL
- GLSL vs writing WebGL in JS?
