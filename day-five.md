# Day Five:
Day Five, I have sadly arrive at my last day of my mini batch. As expected, I didn't get much done for my project, but I managed to squeeze in as many pairing sessions as possible, though not as many as I would've liked. Pairing was incredibly productive and I made a few breakthroughs with understanding and manipulating WebGL that I'm pretty proud of. I can safely say that at the end of the week, I have successfully reached my goal of being able to draw shapes and animate them across a screen! This was all thanks to the time spent working through the problem with my very helpful pairs today. Yay! 

## Things Learned
- Animating a shape across a screen

## Things to Learn (that I know of)
- Drawing a circle in WebGL
- 3D stuff
- Working with perspective/camera

## Thoughts moving forward

;TLDR
- Lurk on Zulip
- Connect with RC Alums in Chicago
- Blog post about process for organizing a technical talk? -> I got great feedback on my 5min presentation about how the format I used to explain a high level concept worked :D 
- A blog post series exploring backend concepts from the lens of a frontend developer (this idea excites me quite a bit)
